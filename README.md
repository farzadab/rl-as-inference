# RL as Inference
A case study on the applicability of solving RL tasks when posed as inference problems. As defined in [[Levine 2018]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00909.pdf) we define our tasks as structured variational inference problems and use [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/) (a probabilistic programming language) to solve them.
